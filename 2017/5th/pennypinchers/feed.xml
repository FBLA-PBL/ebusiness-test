So here’s a synopsis on how the goal to “develop character, prepare for useful citizenship, and foster patriotism” has played a role in my life. Enjoy!</div><div>Growing up with two hard working and loving immigrant parents has been one of my greatest joys in life. As a child, they had always instilled in me the power and value behind education and opportunities. Till this day I still recall the words my mother would continuously repeat to me as I was growing up, “Remember that your father and I are doing the best that we can to provide you with everything you need to be successful in school, but you need to make sure you do your part and STUDY, so that you won’t have to work as hard as your father and I”. My mother and father came to the United States with the hope of fulfilling their American Dream which was to be provided with more opportunities and escape the poverty and limitations that were placed upon them in their respective countries. And although their journey was a struggle, it would soon become the epitome of all my ambition and motivation that has led me to develop character, prepare for useful citizenship, and foster patriotism.</div><img src="http://media0.giphy.com/media/65kQC6Mg4XIsw/giphy.gif"/><div>To this very day, I still remember being an optimistic and indecisive little girl with hopes and dreams that would change EVERY year. For instance, I remember being 6 years old and wanting to work at McDonalds so I could increase my happy meal toy collection, being 7 and wanting to be a pediatrician.. who didn’t make kids cry, and being 8 years old and wanting to be a dentist so that I could give out candy as opposed to dental floss. Now, It wasn’t until the ages of 13-14, that I decided my ultimate goal would be graduate from a four year university, and make my parents proud, however, I knew that in order for me to fully optimize this goal, I would first have to seek opportunities that would help me Develop character.</div><div>As a freshman in High School, I had always assumed leadership roles were beyond me. I still remember “that day”. That day occurred my freshman year in high school. I had a health teacher named Mr. Thrasher, who knew that I was one of the most timid and introverted freshman. Every Wednesday he would make me stand in front of the class and deliver a speech regarding health issues to the most intimidating group of 33 students. I still recall the moment I walked up to the front of my class, set my report on the podium and turned an ENTIRELY different hue of red. As I opened my mouth and attempted to let the words flow through, my voice cracked and everything went downhill from there. At the time, I was completely blind to the fact that the objective of my health teacher wasn’t to humiliate me, but to help me become more comfortable and confident in myself and my speaking abilities.</div><div>Now, my whole life I assumed I was an introvert because I had always been very timid when it came to speaking in front of large groups of people. I was never active in any clubs and always stayed within my own comfort zone. However, I had always told myself that I wanted to change, go from being an introvert to becoming an extrovert. I knew that I wanted to gain a remarkable aptitude for networking and communicating. Even if that would mean getting out of my comfort zone and speaking in front of large groups of people. This desire of stepping out of my comfort zone and challenging myself was the first step in developing my character.</div><div>As the years progressed, I began to expand on my speaking and leadership skills. My second year of High School, I became a member of the Entrepreneurship Academy where I began to acquire skills that would further my interest and passion for business and professional growth. I learned a lot about the basic characteristics of honesty, respect, and I also learned to acknowledge and leverage team strengths. When I joined FBLA my junior year, I was given the opportunity to thrive on that platform that IS Business Leadership and self - Empowerment. Furthermore, I was given the opportunity to step out of my comfort zone and play an active role within my school and community.</div><div>And It was through community service projects that FBLA has helped prepare me for useful citizenship. This past year, I was given the opportunity to travel across the state visiting other high schools and informing students about the benefits that came with joining FBLA and Career Technical Education programs. Opportunities like these were very rewarding to me, not only because I got to travel for free, but because I was able to offer students a portal to their future and most of all… an OPPORTUNITY. An opportunity that would allow students to thrive in this mixed market economy and grow as innovative leaders.</div><div>In addition, FBLA has also fostered patriotism within me. I can never help, but wonder what would have become of me had my parents not came to U.S.. I look around me and see that people have freedom, education and most importantly opportunities that can help people thrive regardless of their income, gender, or even race. And for that I’m thankful, and proud to call myself an American.</div><div>Future Business Leaders of America has provided me a foundation through which I can combine both business and education and set forth the development of character, useful citizenship and patriotism.</div><div>Ashley Mazariegos</div><div>Penny Pincher CEO</div></div>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>2017 FBLA E-business, 5th Place | First Impressions Are KEY</title><description><![CDATA[Hey Friends,Jaleesa here, your fellow penny pincher and I am here to talk to you guys a little bit about the difference between casual and professional dress.

Now, you may be wondering … Why in the world do I care? Well friends, I am here to tell you that the differences between these two things can save you from a lot of embarrassment and humiliation in the long run. Knowing about these differences will help you understand how to dress accordingly for different situations (these situations might include interviews, FBLA competitive event presentations and much more).</div><div>As a fellow FBLA member myself, I can tell you that I have learned a lot about professional dress after attending my first regional competitions. I still remember the day I walked into my competition wearing sneakers and sweater, and MAN was I embarrassed. Not only was I completely under dressed for that occasion, but I also made a terrible impression on the judges. However, i’m not here to tell you about my tragic stories, I am writing to you today so that I can help you avoid uncomfortable situations like these.</div><div>Within the business world, there are two types of dress:</div><div>CasualProfessional</div><img src="http://media0.giphy.com/media/StDS4C5kNovyU/giphy.gif"/><div>Casual dress is the style that students like you and I prefer the most because it’s the most comfortable. For men, this type of attire will mainly consist of polos or a nice shirt, tucked in some nice casual pants (sometimes jeans are acceptable, but usually you want to go with Khakis) and belt that matches the color of your shoes. As always, you want to make sure you follow up on good hygiene and always look presentable. As for my ladies, you want to make sure that whatever you wear is similar to that of an outfit of a school teacher's. Usually an outfit like this would consist of a nice polo, or blouse, worn with nice khaki pants or skirt and closed toed shoes. Jewelry is fine as long as it’s not an excess amount (pearls are always the way to go). It is also important that you pull up your hair or pin it back so that your hair is not near your face. ALSO, hygeine is equally as important for women as it is for men. Always remember to NEVER overload on any perfume or cologne.</div><div>Now, as for professional dress, here are some of the DO’s and DONT’s:</div><div>DO’s for Men: - Wear a nice dress shirt, nice dress pants, belt with matching shoes, blazer and a tie. ALSO! Remember to Iron your clothes (makes it look nice and professional)!</div><div>DON'Ts for men:</div><div>Never wear an untucked shirtNever wear a bow tie instead of a tie (unless notified to do so)</div><div>DO’s for Women: For women it is important to wear a suit. Whether it be a pantsuit or a skirt suit, or even a dress, it is important to always wear a blazer and closed toes shoes. Never wear an excess of jewelry, make-up or perfume. It’s important to always have a professional appearance and often times this professional look requires neutral colors.</div><div>DON’Ts for Women:</div><div>Never wear any piercings on your body other than on your earsShort dresses, short skirtsSuper tight clothing</div><div>Well folks, that’s all I have for you today!
